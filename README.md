* CODE white paper on <a href=" https://www.opendataenterprise.org/publications#Future-Health-Data">Ensuring the Future of Essential Health Data for All Americans</a>. On July 9 and 10, 2025, CODE co-hosted an online Roundtable on preserving and improving essential data for public health with the National Conference on Citizenship. The resulting white paper provides an in-depth analysis of the state of public health data today and recommendations for action.

## Gold Standard Science Resources
* <strong><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vT1twDRxByOKiV8eMIauTP2K4l9Gj47Cg_O4Ye8rhQNJ2gCW3nkU-LDGPMznn9kAmPcLRSKHKNC0Lrg/pubhtml?gid=0&single=true" target="_blank">Federal Agency Gold Standard Science (GSS) Implementation Comparison Chart</a></strong>. This resource was developed by the Center for Open Science in collaboration with other mission-aligned organizations to share links to agency GSS reports submitted to the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) in August 2025, as instructed by OSTP in <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/OSTP-Guidance-for-GSS-June-2025.pdf" target="_blank">June 2025 guidance to agencies on GSS implementation</a>. The resource includes at high-level existing policies cited in agency reports, links to scientific integrity policies, opportunities to support or hold agencies accountable in GSS implementation, and notable caveats outlined in agency reports. The resource is a work in progress and comments from the community are welcome to improve its utility and accuracy.

This statement authored by the National Academies Strategy Council in August 2025 aims to assist federal agencies with developing the required implementation plan by oﬀering a set of cross-cutting observations.

## Trackers on Funding Impacts to Science
* <a href="https://scienceimpacts.org/" target="_blank">SCIMaP</a>, a project to help Americans explore how science and health research fuels the economy, supports jobs, and improves health outcomes. A June 2025 <em>Nature Human Bheaviour</em> <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-025-02238-x" target="_blank">correspondence</a> outlines the project's methodology (though the article is paywalled).
* <a href="https://theimpactproject.org/" target="_blank">The Impact Project</a>, which builds tools to demonstrate the nationwide value of public service on communities across the country. Maps track the individual impact of federal changes across different dimensions.
