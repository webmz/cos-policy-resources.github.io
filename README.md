# Resources from COS Colloquium on Charting a Path for Research Integrity
## Gold Standard Science (GSS) EO-related Resources
* <strong><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vT1twDRxByOKiV8eMIauTP2K4l9Gj47Cg_O4Ye8rhQNJ2gCW3nkU-LDGPMznn9kAmPcLRSKHKNC0Lrg/pubhtml?gid=0&single=true" target="_blank">Federal Agency Gold Standard Science (GSS) Implementation Comparison Chart</a></strong>. This resource was developed by the Center for Open Science in collaboration with other mission-aligned organizations to share links to agency GSS reports submitted to the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) in August 2025, as instructed by OSTP in <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/OSTP-Guidance-for-GSS-June-2025.pdf" target="_blank">June 2025 guidance to agencies on GSS implementation</a>. The resource includes at high-level existing policies cited in agency reports, links to scientific integrity policies, opportunities to support or hold agencies accountable in GSS implementation, and notable caveats outlined in agency reports. The resource is a work in progress and comments from the community are welcome to improve its utility and accuracy.
* <strong><a href="https://www.nationalacademies.org/cdn/materials/9fea97a6-ae38-4970-801f-ae7b7433655c" target="_blank">A Response to OSTP Agency Guidance for Implementing Gold Standard Science in the Conduct & Management of Scientific Activities</a></strong>. This statement authored by the National Academies Strategy Council in August 2025 aims to assist federal agencies with developing the required implementation plan by oﬀering a set of cross-cutting observations.
* <strong><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/topic/science/trust-in-science/" target="_blank">Pew Research Center's research on public trust in science</a></strong>. The GSS EO cites loss of public trust in science when trust in science is a much more nuanced subject. Pew has long-standing public polling on perceptions of science relevant to considering communications around the Executive Order.
### Increasing Public Access to Federally-Funded Research
Many of the agency GSS reports reference long-standing policies and processes agencies have in place to increase public access to federally-funded research. Below, we share resources for complying with existing public access policies, as well as articles on the implications of administration actions on public access policies.
* AAU and the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities (APLU) published a <a href="https://www.aau.edu/accelerating-public-access-research-data" target="_blank">Guide to Accelerate Public Access to Research Data</a>, which builds on many prior efforts and is consistent with national and global open science efforts as well as international declarations.
* December 2025 <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/research/2025/12/05/nih-policy-holding-researchers-hostage" target="_blank">article</a> from <em>Inside Higher Ed</em> on implications of the National Institutes of Health's (NIH) policy on public access to publications.

## Funding Impacts to Science Trackers and Analyses
* <a href="https://scienceimpacts.org/" target="_blank">SCIMaP</a>, a project to help Americans explore how science and health research fuels the economy, supports jobs, and improves health outcomes. A June 2025 <em>Nature Human Bheaviour</em> <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-025-02238-x" target="_blank">correspondence</a> outlines the project's methodology (though the article is paywalled).
* <a href="https://theimpactproject.org/" target="_blank">The Impact Project</a>, which builds tools to demonstrate the nationwide value of public service on communities across the country. Maps track the individual impact of federal changes across different dimensions.
* <em>New York Times</em> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/12/02/upshot/trump-science-funding-cuts.html" target="_blank">analysis on funding cuts to science and medicine</a>, published on December 2, 2025.
* In the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Fiscal-Year-2026-Discretionary-Budget-Request.pdf" target="_blank">FY26 President’s Budget</a>, OMB required NIH to substantially increase the number of multi-year awards (or forward fund awards) instead of funding grants one year at a time. <a href="https://www.actfornih.org/about/" target="_blank">Act for NIH</a> devleoped <a href="https://www.researchamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ACT-for-NIH-Multi-Year-Funding-One-Pager_October-2025.pdf" target="_blank">a one-pager</a> on the impact of this proposed change.
### Indirect Costs
* The American Association of Universities (AAU) has developed <a href="https://www.aau.edu/key-issues/financial-accountability-research-fair-model" target="_blank">the Financial Accountability in Research (FAIR) model</a>.

## Efforts around Open Data Infrastructure
* CODE white paper on <a href="http://reports.opendataenterprise.org/America_Data_Future_Final.pdf" target="_blank">America's Data Future: Towards a Roadmap for Action</a> published in July 2025.
* CODE white paper on <a href="https://www.opendataenterprise.org/publications#Future-Health-Data" target="_blank">Ensuring the Future of Essential Health Data for All Americans</a>. On July 9 and 10, 2025, CODE co-hosted an online Roundtable on preserving and improving essential data for public health with the National Conference on Citizenship. The resulting white paper provides an in-depth analysis of the state of public health data today and recommendations for action.
* <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/M-26-03-Presidents-Management-Agenda.pdf" target="_blank">President's Management Budget</a> has some references to efforts to eliminate silos in data collection, which may provide an advocacy tool for the open data community to advocate for a more efficient collection and management system.
* COS was recently <a href="https://www.cos.io/about/news/center-for-open-science-awarded-grant-from-robert-wood-johnson-foundation-to-preserve-and-safeguard-publicly-funded-scientific-data?hs_preview=zGFgbAHj-199947975471" target="_blank">awarded funds from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation</a> to develop a strategic plan to coordinate the community to promote a more resilient system for federally-funded scientific data.
